### kernel-javascript

`build.sh` builds the kernel-javascript image.

Once kernel-javascript is upstream in https://github.com/jupyter/enterprise_gateway we shouldn't have to build the kernel image ourselves anymore.

In the meanwhile the Docker image is listed here: https://hub.docker.com/r/orchest/kernel-javascript
